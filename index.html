    <p>Since you haven't had the chance to learn about many Christmas customs and traditions growing up, I think it would
    be nice if you had a chance to hear about them now. <br></br> Each box on this calendar represents a day from December
    1st through December 25th, and each one is locked until the day of (don't sneak ahead by inspecting or anything! that's 
    strictly forbidden!). Each day talks about a Christmas concept, theme, or song, and there will be four gifts somewhere in
    the calendar. 
    <br></br> If there's something wrong, like if a date unlocks early, a link doesn't work, etc., tell me haha. </p>
